🎓 Student Performance Analyzer

A Python desktop application that analyzes and visualizes student performance data from Excel. This project is designed to help teachers, students, and analysts understand student performance trends, identify top performers, and make data-driven decisions.

Project Overview

The Student Performance Analyzer allows users to:

Load student data from Excel files.

Display student records in a user-friendly table.

Compute class statistics: mean, median, mode, maximum, minimum.

Generate PDF reports summarizing student performance.

Visualize data through scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and stacked bar charts.

This project provides a simple way to interpret student data visually and statistically, making it useful for academic analysis, performance tracking, and reporting.

Technologies and Libraries Used

Python 3 – Programming language.

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.

Tkinter – Graphical user interface (GUI).

ReportLab – Generate PDF reports.

OpenPyXL – Read/write Excel files.

How the Project Works

Load an Excel file containing student data (Name, Roll, Marks, Study Hours).

The application displays the data in a table and allows sorting by roll or marks.

Users can analyze statistics, visualize data through charts, and generate PDF reports.

Charts and reports help identify top performers, performance trends, and areas needing improvement.

Why This Project is Useful

Helps teachers quickly assess class performance.

Allows students to understand their progress relative to the class.

Provides easy-to-understand visualizations for performance tracking.

Generates professional PDF reports for record keeping and presentations
